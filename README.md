# Lending club case study
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.  Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss. The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
